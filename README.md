# Chatbot-to-Detect-Fake-News
This is a chatbot based on Telegram to detect fake news. 

## Project Structure
- ``model_train.ipynb`` contains the programs for data preparations and training the model.
- Two ``.pkl`` files store trained models, which are both Logistic Regression Models but the pipeline are building up using sklearnâ€™s CounterVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer respectively.
- ``news.csv`` file is our dataset for training, which can also be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanamin/textdb3). 
- ``teleConfig.py`` file stores our telegram services.

## How to run this project?
1. Replace the ``your_token`` field in line 81 of ``teleConfig.py`` with your bot's token. It should be some string like ``110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw``. If you haven't have a token, see [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather) for help and create one. 
2. Run ``teleConfig.py``.
3. Send messages to your bot.
